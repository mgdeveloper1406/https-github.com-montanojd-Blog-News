Scriptural Rosary
 Introductory Prayers

Make the Sign of the Cross.
Holding the Crucifix, say the Apostlesâ€™ Creed.
On the first bead, say an Our Father.
Say three Hail Marys on each of the next three beads.
Say the Glory Be
Praying the Mysteries

For each of the five decades, announce the Mystery (perhaps followed by a brief reading from Scripture using the links above) then say the Our Father.
While fingering each of the next ten beads, say ten Hail Marys while meditating on the Mystery.
Then say a Glory Be.
After finishing each decade, some say the following prayer requested by the Blessed Virgin Mary at Fatima:
O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell; lead all souls to Heaven, especially those who have most need of your mercy.
