Anima Christi
Soul of Christ, sanctify me

Body of Christ, save me

Blood of Christ, inebriate me

Water from Christâ€™s side, wash me

Passion of Christ, strengthen me

O good Jesus, hear me

Within Thy wounds hide me

Suffer me not to be separated from Thee

From the malicious enemy defend me

In the hour of my death call me

And bid me come unto Thee

That I may praise Thee with Thy saints

and with Thy angels

Forever and ever.

Amen
