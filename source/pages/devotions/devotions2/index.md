Come Holy Spirit
fill the hearts of Your faithful 
and kindle in them the fire of Your love. 
Send forth Your Spirit 
and they shall be created. 
And You shall renew the face of the earth. 
 
O, God, Who by the light of the Holy Spirit, 
did instruct the hearts of the faithful, 
grant that by the same Holy Spirit 
we may be truly wise and ever enjoy His consolations, 
through Christ Our Lord.
 
Amen.
