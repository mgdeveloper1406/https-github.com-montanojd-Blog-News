Carnivore Quiche Muffins

Ingredients
For the crust:
1 lb ground beef
2.5 oz pork rinds
3 eggs
1/2 tsp sea salt
2 tsp sage (optional)
1 tsp thyme (optional)
1/4 tsp nutmeg(optional)
1/4 tsp rosemary (optional)
For the filling:
6 eggs
8 oz raw cheese
1 dash sea salt
For topping:
chopped chives - to taste (optional)
Instructions
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.
Make the beef-pork rind crust dough.
In your blender, blend the pork rinds to a fine powder. Set the pork rind powder aside in your mixing bowl.
Add the sage, thyme, nutmeg, rosemary (if using), and salt to the pork rind powder. Mix together.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
In a blender, blend the raw ground beef and eggs until a smooth paste forms.
Add the beef-egg paste to your mixing bowl and mix to form a dough.
Form the crusts in the cupcake baking pan.
Line the cupcake slots of your cupcake baking pan with the dough and form crusts. See the example pictured in the "Tips to make the best..." section.
Bake the crusts.
Bake the crusts at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.
While the crusts are baking, make the egg-cheese filling.
In your mixing bowl, beat 6 eggs to a smooth consistency. Using a hand mixer is fine, but it is not necessary.
Shred the raw cheese into the mixing bowl. Fold the cheese into the eggs to combine and add a dash of sea salt.
Finish it off.
When the crusts are done baking, remove them from the oven. Fill each crust with the egg-cheese filling.
Note: It's normal if the filling falls outside of the middle and into the sides of the slot. It ends up all baking together into one muffin.
Bake for 15-20 minutes at 375 degrees until the tops turn golden brown.
Optional: add chopped chives prior to baking, if using.
Once the muffins are done baking, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool for about 10 minutes.
Leftovers can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for 4-5 days.
