Depending on the size of your air fryer, you’ll cook them in batches.
Line your fryer basket with liners, if you use them. Otherwise, spray with cooking spray.
Place meatballs in the basket, making sure they do not touch each other or the sides of the basket.
Cook at 350 degrees for 8 minutes. Pull out the basket and turn the meat balls over. Return to fryer and cook at 350 degrees for another 4 minutes.
