Carnivore Quiche
Ingredients
For the crust:
1 lb raw ground pork
5 oz pork rinds (the equivalent of 2 EPIC bags)
3 eggs
1 tbsp grass-fed ghee (or butter)
1/4 tsp sea salt
For the quiche:
6 eggs
1 cup heavy whipping cream
8 oz raw cheese
8 oz bacon
3/4 tsp sea salt
3 tbsp chives (optional)
Instructions
Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees.
Make the crust.
In a blender or food processor, crush the pork rinds to a fine powder. Set the pork rind powder aside.
Melt the ghee on your stovetop.
In a blender, mix the raw ground pork, melted ghee, and eggs until a smooth paste forms.
Add the paste to a mixing bowl. Fold in the pork rind powder and sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) to form a dough. It should be thick and dense.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
Transfer the dough to a pie pan and form the crust.
Note: To form the crust, I started with the dough in the center and pushed it outward, thinning out the bottom. When I got to the edges, I used the edge of my pie pan to make the curled edges. There are tutorials online for fancy ways to make pie crust edges if that interests you.
Note: This crust bakes down, so form it taller than you want it to end up post-baking.
Note: You may have some dough left over. I did. You can freeze the leftover dough for later use, or do what I did: make little mini quiches with it. Use a cupcake baking pan. Fill the slots with the leftover dough, fill with your favorite breakfast toppings (egg, sausage, etc.), and bake for about 20 minutes or until done to your liking.
Bake the crust.
Bake the crust at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.
While the crust is baking, prepare the filling.
Chop up the bacon into thin slivers (like 1/4 inch x 1 inch).
At medium heat, cook the bacon.
Once the bacon is cooked to your liking, remove it from the pan and place it on a plate to cool.
In a mixing bowl, whip the eggs, heaving whipping cream, and sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) for about 1 minute.
With your vegetable (or cheese) grater, shred the raw cheese.
Fold the shredded cheese and bacon pieces into the egg-cream mixture.
Prepare and bake the quiche.
Once the crust is done baking, remove it from the oven.
Pour the quiche filling into the crust. It should fill to the top.
Finely chop the chives (if using) and garnish the quiche with the chives.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes, or until the top crisps and is a nice golden brown color.
Once the quiche is done baking, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool for 10-15 minutes or so. Serve and enjoy!
This quiche makes for great leftovers (arguably tastier than fresh!). If storing for leftovers, place the quiche in an airtight container in the fridge for 4-5 days.
