Perfect Instant Pot Oxtails
Ingredients
2 lbs beef oxtail (including bone)
2 tbsp grass-fed ghee (or butter)
3/4 cup water
sea salt (to taste)
Instructions
Prep the oxtails. Salt both sides liberally with sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off).
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
Press Saute on your Instant Pot for 30 minutes. (Note: for older versions, press 'Saute' button then 'Adjust' button; for newer versions, press 'Saute' button twice.)
While it's warming up, place 2 tbsp of ghee (or fat of choice, although I do highly recommend ghee with this due to its buttery flavor) in the Instant Pot.
Once the unit displays "HOT" on the LED screen, swish around the melted ghee to get an even layer on the floor of the Instant Pot, and place the oxtails inside in an even layer (all bottoms should be touching the floor).
Saute the oxtails on one side for 5 minutes. To get an even char, rotate the oxtails 180 degrees about halfway through.
Flip the oxtails and repeat on the other side: saute for five minutes and rotate 180 degrees about halfway through.
Unplug the Instant Pot (I do this to reset it and change function - I haven't figured out how to change function midway through without unplugging it).
Set it to Manual/High Pressure for 50 minutes. Add 3/4 cup of water. Close and allow to cook.
When the Instant Pot turns off, let it slow release for 10 minutes.
Once slow release is complete, vent the pressure cooker. The oxtails are done!
Divide the oxtails and broth in two, and place in bowls. If you have a salty palette, top with more salt of your choice.
Serve, savor, and enjoy!
