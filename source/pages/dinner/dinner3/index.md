Classic Carnivore Club Sandwich
Ingredients
For the Duck Fat Mayonnaise:
1 cup duck fat
1 egg
2 egg yolks
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1/4 tsp sea salt
For the Carnivore Sandwich Bread:
8 eggs
1 lb raw ground pork
5 oz pork rinds
1/4 cup grass-fed ghee (or butter)
1 tsp sea salt
For the Club Sandwiches:
10 slices bacon
1 family size pack ham
1 family size pack turkey
1 block raw cheese
Instructions
Make the Duck Fat Mayonnaise.
Follow this recipe. Store the mayo in the fridge in an airtight container (or a condiment squeeze bottle, if you prefer) until you're ready to use it.
Make the Carnivore Sandwich Bread.
Follow this recipe. Note: if you can't tolerate pork, make Carnivore Sandwich Bread [Beef Version] instead.
Once done, allow the bread to rest on the countertop or on a cooling rack.
Once cooled, slice the bread into 1-inch thick slices (or whatever thickness you prefer), and set aside.
Cook the bacon.
In a cooking pan or in the oven, cook all of the bacon as you normally do.
Once done, set the bacon aside on a plate to cool.
Put it all together.
Toast the slices of bread, if preferred.
Drizzle the mayo on the insides of both ends of the bread.
Stack the ham, raw cheese, turkey, and bacon on top of the bottom slice of bread, and top with the other slice of bread.
If preferred, cut each sandwich in half. Place toothpicks in the half-sandwiches to hold the pieces together.
Serve, savor, and enjoy!
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for 1-2 days.
