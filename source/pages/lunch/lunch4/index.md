3x
3 eggs
2.5 oz softened cream cheese
¼ cup ground pork rinds
¼ cup grated parmesan

INSTRUCTIONS
 
Mix all ingredients in a bowl and then pour it on to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Spread it thin onto the baking sheet and then baked it at 350 for 7-8 minutes
Once out of the oven I placed the sheet of noodles onto a cutting board and sliced into strips with a pizza cutter.
