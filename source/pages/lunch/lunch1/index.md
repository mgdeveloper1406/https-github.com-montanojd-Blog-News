Carnivore Pizza
Ingredients
For the Carnivore Pizza Crust:
1 lb ground chicken (or ground meat of your choice)
3 eggs
5 oz pork rinds
1 tbsp grass-fed ghee (or butter)
1 tbsp Italian seasoning (optional)
1/4 tsp sea salt
For the Carnivore Pizza:
8 oz raw cheese
10 pieces bacon
1 lb ground pork
8-10 slices pepperoni
1 tbsp Italian seasoning
sea salt (to taste)
Instructions
Make the Carnivore Pizza Crust.
Follow this recipe.
While the crust is baking, prepare the toppings. Start by making the bacon.
Chop up the bacon into thin slivers (like 1/4 inch x 1 inch).
At medium heat, cook the bacon.
Once the bacon is cooked to your liking, remove it from the pan and place it on a plate to cool.
Make the sausage.
Add the ground pork to the pan with the bacon fat and increase to medium-high heat.
Add the Italian seasoning (if using) and salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) to taste.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
Cook the ground pork in the bacon fat until browned. Your goal is a nice, deep brown char. This usually takes 10-15 minutes.
Once the sausage is cooked to your liking, remove it from heat and leave it to cool.
Once the Carnivore Pizza Crust is finished baking, add the toppings to the pizza.
Grate the block of raw cheese over the body of the pizza crust to form a thick layer.
On top of the cheese, add the cooked sausage and bacon.
Garnish with pepperoni.
Bake the pizza (with the toppings) at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes.
Once the toppings have melted and set, remove the pizza from the oven.
Let it cool for 10-15 minutes, then serve and devour!
This pizza is best served fresh, although it will last in the fridge for 3-4 days in an airtight container.
