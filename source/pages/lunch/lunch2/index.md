Carnivore Fried Chicken Strips
Ingredients
1.5 lbs chicken thighs
6 oz pork cracklings (the equivalent of 2 4505 bags; pork rinds are fine, but pork cracklings work better)
2 eggs
sea salt (to taste)
Instructions
Make the breading.
Take the pork cracklings* and blend them until they reach the consistency of an oily powder.
*Note: Pork rinds will work too, however, I could not achieve as thick of a breading layer with pork rinds.
Place the pork crackling powder in a medium-sized bowl.
Prepare the chicken strips.
Cut the chicken thighs into strips. I cut mine into strips that were about 4 inches long and 1/2-1 inch wide, but you can cut yours into whatever size you prefer.
Make the fried chicken.
Beat two eggs in a small bowl.
Dip each chicken strip into the egg mixture. Once fully coated, immerse it into the pork crackling powder and roll it around until it's fully coated with a thick layer. The powder will be oily and should stick together. Make sure the breading layer is thick.
Note: You can bake these in your oven, use an air fryer (that’s what I did), or use traditional deep frying methods. I’ve personally tried them in both an oven and an air fryer with success. I have never tried to deep fry them, but readers have done so with success.
Place the coated chicken strips onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) them liberally.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
If using a traditional oven, bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, flip, then bake for another 20-25 minutes. The coating should be hard to the touch and crunchy when the chicken strips are finished. I made these in my air fryer and the same temp/time (20 min-20 min at 400 degrees) worked well.
Serve and enjoy! Make some Onion-Free Guacamole, Honey Mustard, or Duck Fat Ranch Dressing for dipping.
If you plan on saving them for later, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days.
