Carnivore Baguettes

Ingredients
8 eggs
1 lb raw ground pork
5 oz pork rinds (the equivalent of 2 EPIC bags)
1 tbsp grass-fed ghee (or butter)
1.5 tsp sea salt
Instructions
Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl. Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks. Place the egg yolks in your blender (for later use).
With a hand mixer, beat the whites on high until the mixture is very frothy and you have soft peaks. The mixture should be light like foam.
Melt the ghee on your stovetop.
In a blender, mix the raw ground pork, melted ghee, and egg yolks until a smooth paste forms.
With a hand mixer, blend the frothy egg whites and the pork-ghee-egg yolk paste until the mixture becomes smooth like batter.
In a blender or food processor, crush the pork rinds to a fine powder.
Fold the pork rind powder and sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) into the batter.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
Place the batter in the fridge for 10 minutes to rest and harden into dough.
Once ready, form the dough into 12-15 inch long baguettes and place in the baguette baking pan.
Form the ends of the baguettes into points, and make 4-5 diagonal slashes on the top of each baguette.
Place in the oven for 50 minutes at 375 degrees.
Slice the baguettes into 1-inch thick slices. Top with the spread of your choice.
Store in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Enjoy!
