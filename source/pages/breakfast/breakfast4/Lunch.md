Carnivore Beef Liver Pancakes

Ingredients
3 oz raw beef liver
3 eggs
4 tbsp grass-fed ghee
sea salt
Instructions
Blend the raw liver, eggs, 3 tbsp of ghee (room temperature/softened), and a dash of sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) in a blender until smooth. No liver chunks should be left.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
Make as you would normal pancakes at medium heat, with the exception of cook time and resting from heat. **See note below.
Top with 1 tbsp of ghee, and honey if you tolerate it/prefer. Enjoy!

Notes
**Important notes:
Beef liver cooks VERY quickly, so these pancakes will cook fast (usually about 15-20 seconds per side). Sometimes slightly more or less. You'll know to flip it when the batter starts to bubble and the bottom of the pancake has solidified.
These pancakes like a lot of fat while cooking, so between every 1-2 pancakes, add some ghee to the pan.
Between each pancake, I let the pan rest from heat for about 10 seconds. I pour the next pancake onto the pan while it is removed from heat, and after about 5 seconds, I add the pan back to heat. This prevents the pancake batter from sizzling, cooking too fast, and burning.
I usually pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake. One batch makes about 6 pancakes. The pictured stack is a double batch.
