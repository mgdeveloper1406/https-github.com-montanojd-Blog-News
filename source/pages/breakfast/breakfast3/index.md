Carnivore Sandwich Bread
Ingredients
8 eggs
1 lb raw ground beef
1/4 cup grass-fed ghee (or butter)
1.5 tsp sea salt
Instructions
Start the oven.
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.
Make the batter.
Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl. Separate the egg whites from the egg yolks. Place the egg yolks in your blender (for later use).
With a hand mixer, beat the whites on high until the mixture is very frothy and you have soft peaks. The mixture should be light like foam.
Melt the ghee on your stovetop.
In a blender, mix the raw ground beef, melted ghee, egg yolks, and sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) until a smooth paste forms.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
With a hand mixer, blend the frothy egg whites and the beef-ghee-egg yolk paste until the mixture becomes smooth like batter.
Bake the loaf.
Pour the batter into your bread pan and bake in the oven for 100-105 minutes at 375 degrees.
Note: You'll know it's done when the texture is consistent, dry, grainy, and bread-like throughout. When you cut into the loaf, if it has slimy patches that look like chunks of egg, it's not done.
Once done, remove the loaf from the oven and allow it to cool for 10-15 minutes.
Prepare and serve.
Slice the loaf into 1-inch thick slices, or whatever size you prefer.
Important: the texture of this bread is similar to egg loaf. To get a crispy texture, I recommend toasting or pan-frying. Scroll up to see photos of the texture of this bread when fresh, toasted, and pan-fried under the "Tips to make the best..." section. If you can tolerate pork, my standard Carnivore Sandwich Bread recipe comes out with more of a natural crisp/crunch (without toasting or pan-frying) that is similar to regular bread.
Meal ideas: Make a Classic Carnivore Club Sandwich, Pulled Pork Sandwich, or toast a slice and top with Strawberry Glaze and Honey Butter or Onion-Free Guacamole.
Store in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Enjoy!
