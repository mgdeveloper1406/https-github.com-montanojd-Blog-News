Carnivore Beef Liver Waffles
Ingredients
3 oz raw beef liver
3 eggs
4 tbsp grass-fed ghee (or butter)
sea salt (to taste)
Instructions
Turn on your waffle maker so it can heat up while you prepare the batter.
Blend the raw liver, eggs, 3 tbsp of ghee (room temperature/softened), and a dash of sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) in a blender until smooth. No liver chunks should be left.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
Make as you would normal waffles, with the exception of cook time. **See note below.
Top with 1 tbsp of ghee, and honey if you tolerate it/prefer. Enjoy!
Looking for an even sweeter version? Try Blueberry Beef Liver Waffles with Honey Butter.
Notes
**Important note: Beef liver cooks VERY quickly, so the waffles will cook in seconds (usually about 15-20 seconds or so). When the waffles turn light brown and there is no gooey residue left, you will know they are done. The waffles will shrivel a bit. This is normal.
The ingredients yield about 1.5 cups of batter. I usually pour about 1/2 cup of batter per waffle into an 8-inch waffle maker and make 3 waffles per batch.
