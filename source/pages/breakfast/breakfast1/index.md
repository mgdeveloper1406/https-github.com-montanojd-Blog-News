Carnivore Tortillas
Ingredients
5 oz pork rinds (the equivalent of 2 EPIC bags)
6 eggs
1 tbsp grass-fed ghee (or butter) (+ extra for cooking)
2 cups water
1 tsp sea salt
Instructions
Make the tortilla batter.
If you're using pork rind pieces, grind them in a blender or food processor to a fine powder.
Add the water, eggs, 1 tbsp ghee, and sea salt (ASHLEYR for 15% off) to the pork rind powder and blend until smooth. The batter should be liquid-like and not thick.
Note: if you go through tons of salt in your household like we do, check out this salt purchasing hack that will save you money + make things more efficient. We started this last year, and I'm so happy we did!
Transfer the batter to a bowl for handling ease.
Make the tortillas.
Add some ghee (about a tsp) to an 8" cooking pan and bring to low-medium heat. For reference, my stove uses numbers as markers for heat. '8' is the highest setting before 'HIGH.' I set my burner to about 3-3.5 for the tortillas.
Measure out just under 1/4 cup of batter. IMPORTANT: The batter should always have a liquid consistency when pouring it into the pan, and it should pour out quickly. Not as quickly as a pure liquid like water, but more like a thin milkshake. If your batter gets too thick while sitting, add some water to it until it gets to the consistency of a thick liquid.
Pour the batter into the pan (quickly) starting in the center of the pan and spiral out to fill the pan. IMPORTANT: The batter should fill up the entire 8" pan, but not curl up around the edges. If the batter sizzles when you pour, the pan is too hot. Before pouring, remove the pan from heat until it cools enough so that it makes no noise or sizzling sound when you pour the batter.
Cook the tortilla on one side for about 7 minutes, flip, and then the other side for about 3 minutes. Your cook time may be slightly longer or shorter depending on your stovetop.
Once the tortilla is done, set it aside on a paper towel or cooling rack to rest.
Between each tortilla, remove the pan from heat and add ghee to the pan. IMPORTANT: The pan should stay well lubricated with fat for each tortilla, or else the tortillas will burn. I use about a tsp of ghee for every 2 tortillas.
Repeat this process until the batter is gone. IMPORTANT: Because you will likely be adding water to your batter to get to a liquid consistency, you may feel like the batter will never end. ðŸ™‚ It may be a good idea to start with a half batch for your first round of these.
Use these tortillas to make Chicken Bacon Tacos, or get creative with your own tacos/wraps. Enjoy!
